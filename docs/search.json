This is a demo only.\nThis platform is web-hosted so you can simply share a link with collaborators for their review.\n\nMaps and charts are intended to represent general patterns, and are almost always limited to most common types (e.g., ecosystems). You can use the “zoom” tool to take a closer look.\nAll maps, input datasets and further assistance can be obtained by contacting the author, Randy Swaty."

To use:\n\nHover over the outer bands to see connections. For example, if you over over the dark green outer band of the “Past Conifer” group you can see that some is now mapped as converted, some hardwood, etc., and that the majority is still mapped as conifer.\nAlternatively, if you hover over the orange outer band of “Hardwood” you can see what the present extent of hardwoods vegetation was historically.\nThe popups contain acres for the band."
