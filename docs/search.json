This is a demo only.\nThis platform is web-hosted so you can simply share a link with collaborators for their review.\n\nMaps and charts are intended to represent general patterns, and are almost always limited to most common types (e.g., ecosystems). You can use the “zoom” tool to take a closer look.\nAll maps, input datasets and further assistance can be obtained by contacting the author, Randy Swaty."

We will use this data to explore the most prevalent BpSs in a chart and map, and also the historical disturbance data that are linked to the BpSs."

    "text": "Summary\nHistorically the top 10 BpSs represented ~85% of the landscape, and ~ 3% of the total area of the Ottawa being disturbed yearly.\n\nCumulatively ~32K acres of the Ottawa would have been disturbed every year historically, with wind/weather/stress, insects/disease and surface fire being the dominant disturbances.\nThe Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods Forest-Hemlock, Boreal White Spruce-Fir-Hardwood Forest-Inland and\nBoreal Jack Pine-Black Spruce Forest - Pine Barrens BpSs covered over 50% of the Ottawa.\nWhile the Ottawa was not dominated by fire-dependent ecosystems, there were important pockets of ecosystems that would have had surfance fire frequently (< 20 years between fires)."
